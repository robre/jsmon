JSMon - JavaScript Change Monitor for BugBounty

This is a fork of JSMon by robre modified to support Slack instead of Telegram with some minor fixes. You'll need to create a Slack OAuth app then assign it `files:write` and   `files:write:user` permissions the replace `SLACK_TOKEN` in the source code with your own.
